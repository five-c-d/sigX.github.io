**What is sigX+sigGesT?**  [110% unofficial](https://github.com/sigX/sigX.github.io/wiki/Whitepaper#overall-disclaimer) auxiliary [community](https://community.SignalUsers.org) of volunteers who want to improve [Signal](https://signal.org) by upmerging awesome stuff.

**What's the point?**  The primary purpose of this project is to help friendly volunteer developers to collaborate ‚Äì with each other and with test-pilots ‚Äì on experimental feature and bugfixes.  Together, these auxiliaries create incremental solutions, gradually made *superbly*-ready to submit to the Signal Foundation. This way, Foundation folks have to do almost zero work to upmerge into Signal, should they accept a given contribution.

**How does it work?**  Every few weeks, [the repo-maintainer](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ#who-is-in-charge) pins a chosen [upstream](https://github.com/signalapp) tagged-version into sig4a [master branch](https://github.com/sigX/sig4a). Then, dev-squads:

*  sign the [CLA](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-the-contributor-license-agreement-cla),
*  fork master,
*  write [awesome code](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ#developer-faq),
*  PR their branches back,
*  collaboratively code-review,
*  smoke-test sigGesT pre-releases, and eventually
*  code-sign the unofficial alpha-testing release.

The sigGesT coordinator announces each [alpha-testing-binary](https://github.com/sigx/sig4a/releases/) in [signalUsers](https://community.SignalUsers.org/c/development). Test-pilot crews:

*  [sideload it](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ#safety-and-security-faq) (üêâüêâüêâ),
*  register a telco-num with Signal [staging-servers](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ#how-can-it-impact-the-signal-servers),
*  kick the tires on daily-driver handsets,
*  then upload [identifiably distinct](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ#why-are-the-alpha-testing-binaries-named-oddly)  debuglogs
*  and design-critiques to [signalUsers](https://community.SignalUsers.org/c/feature-requests).

**Sounds a bit ambitious!** Bug-reports against stock upstream, feature-request threads, [beta-testing participation](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ#does-it-eat-into-testing-time-for-the-official-beta-channels), and other typical community-involvement, continue happening as usual:  sigX is in a [separate repo to avoid wasting time](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ#is-this-project-another-libresig-doomed-to-fail) of Signal Foundation devs, but the center of interaction will be signalUsers, and the endgoal is *always* to upmerge.

Teamwork within sigX+sigGesT is friendly, no-deadline, self-organizing community, where [legal aspects](https://github.com/sigX/sigX.github.io/wiki/Whitepaper#sigx-credit) are taken seriously.

**Get involved**: read our longer [FAQ](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ), for test-pilots the [quickstart](https://github.com/sigX/sig4a/wiki/Quickstart), our sig4a [releases (and pre-releases)](https://github.com/sigX/sig4a/releases), for devs the [README](https://github.com/sigX/sig4a/blob/master/README.md), and a detailed [whitepaper](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/Whitepaper).

**You can contact us** by sending an email to `sigXperiments@pm.me` or (preferably!) by commenting at the unofficial https://community.signalUsers.org forum please.
