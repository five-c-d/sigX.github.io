**What is sigX+sigGesT?**  [110% unofficial](https://github.com/sigX/sigX.github.io/wiki/Whitepaper#overall-disclaimer) volunteer auxiliary-[community](https://community.SignalUsers.org) of folks who want to improve [Signal](https://signal.org) by upmerging awesome stuff -- [sigX](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ#what-is-sigx)periments+[sigGesT](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ#what-is-siggest)ions.  

**What's the point?**  The primary purpose of the project is to help friendly volunteer devs collaborate – with each other and with test-pilots – on experimental feature-implementations and/or bugfixes.  Together, these auxiliaries create incremental solutions, gradually made *superbly*-ready to submit to the Signal Foundation – in a format where Foundation folks have to do almost zero work to upmerge into Signal, should they green-light any given idea. 

**How does it work?**  Every few weeks, [the repo-maintainer](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ#who-is-in-charge) pins a chosen [upstream](https://github.com/signalapp) tagged-version (from the mirroring-bot) into [master](https://github.com/sigX/sig4a). Dev-squads 

*  [sign the CLA](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-the-contributor-license-agreement-cla), 
*  fork [master](https://github.com/Junkii7/sig4a), 
*  write [code](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ#new-code-faq), 
*  PR their branches [back](https://github.com/sigx/sig4a/blob/master/README.md), 
*  [collaboratively](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-collaborate-as-a-developer) code-review, 
*  [smoke-test](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ#how-are-compilation-conflicts-handled) x999pre1/etc, 
*  [CI](https://travis-ci.com/sigX/sig4a/builds), and eventually 
*  [code-sign](https://github.com/sigX/sig4a/blob/master/README.md) x999.  

The sigGesT coordinator announces [alpha-testing-binary](https://github.com/sigx/sig4a/releases/) x999 in [signalUsers](https://community.SignalUsers.org/c/development), test-pilot crews 

*  [sideload it](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ#safety-and-security-faq), 
*  register [a telco-num](https://community.signalusers.org/t/solution-for-registering-signal-anonymously/6329/18) with [Foundation](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ#how-can-it-impact-the-signal-servers)-provided [staging-servers](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/blob/development/CONTRIBUTING.md#linking-to-a-staging-mobile-device), 
*  kick the tires [on daily-driver handsets](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ#but-isnt-this-extremely-dangerous), 
*  then upload ([identifiably distinct](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ#why-are-the-alpha-testing-binaries-named-oddly)) debuglogs 
*  and design-critiques to [signalUsers](https://community.SignalUsers.org/c/feature-requests).  

**Sounds a bit ambitious!** Bug-reports against stock upstream, feature-request threads, beta-testing [participation](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ#does-it-eat-into-testing-time-for-the-official-beta-channels), and other typical community-involvement, continue happening as usual:  sigX is in a [separate repo to avoid wasting time](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ#is-this-project-another-libresig-doomed-to-fail) of Signal Foundation devs, but the center of interactions will be signalUsers, and the [endgoal](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ#what-is-the-overall-goal-here) *always* is [to upmerge](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/pull).  

Teamwork within sigX+sigGesT is [friendly](https://github.com/sigX/sigX.github.io/wiki/Whitepaper#siggest--what-siggest-is-about) no-deadline community-driven async [self-organizing](https://github.com/sigX/sigX.github.io/wiki/Whitepaper#overall-overview-of-sigx-squads-siggest-crews-unofficial-alpha-test-binaries-etc) collaboration, designed to [save time&money](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ#wouldnt-it-be-a-lot-easier-if-sigxsiggest-were-run-by-the-foundation) for Foundation folks, whilst being [careful](https://github.com/sigX/sigX.github.io/wiki/Whitepaper#sigx-files-added-or-changed) with [legal matters](https://github.com/sigX/sigX.github.io/wiki/Whitepaper#sigx-credit). 

**Get involved**:  our longer [FAQ](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/FAQ), for test-pilots the [quickstart](https://github.com/sigX/sig4a/wiki/Quickstart), the sig4a [releases (and pre-releases)](https://github.com/sigX/sig4a/releases), for devs the [README](https://github.com/sigX/sig4a/blob/master/README.md), and a detailed [whitepaper](https://github.com/sigx/sigX.github.io/wiki/Whitepaper).
